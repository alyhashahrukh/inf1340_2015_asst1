# Assignment Outline
# Write a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the number of
# sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message. Your program
# should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If the input something other
# than the numbers 3 to 10 then your program should display 'Error'. Your code should be easily readable.
# The function should include comments, proper variable naming and produce messages in case of errors.
# Add your code and test cases to the starter file, exercise2.py, that has been provided. Do not
# change the names of the functions in the file.
